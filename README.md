## Description ##
SVMHeart(Final).ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of building and evaluating Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to predict heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. The notebook covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and multiple experiments with different feature sets and train-test splits. It compares the performance of various SVM kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF, sigmoid) and reports accuracy, recall, and precision for each experiment, helping identify the optimal configuration for heart disease prediction. Visualizations such as accuracy plots and confusion matrices are included for model evaluation.
